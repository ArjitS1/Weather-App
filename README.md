# Weather-App

This was made using OpenWeatherMap api.
This project was made by following [Android N dev course - Rob Percival](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-android-n-developer-course/)


P.S :
I was working with Android quite a while ago,so I dont know how to use git with Android Studio.,hence a zip file has been uploaded:)
